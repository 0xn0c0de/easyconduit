# EasyConduit: Step-by-Step User Guide (Hetzner VPS)

This guide is for users who have never set up a server. You will:

1. Get a Telegram bot token and chat ID.
2. Download and install PuTTY and PuTTYgen, then create and keep an SSH key in PuTTYgen.
3. Create a server on Hetzner and add your SSH key.
4. Connect to the server once using PuTTY.
5. Run one command, type or paste your token and chat ID when asked, then press Enter for the rest.
6. Close PuTTY. From then on, you do everything in Telegram (live dashboard and bot commands).

**No config files. No server knowledge needed after the first time.**

**Time:** About 20–25 minutes.  
**You need:** A Windows PC, an email address, a payment method for Hetzner, and a Telegram account.
