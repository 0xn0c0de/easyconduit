# EasyConduit: Config file format and bot commands (optional reference)

Most users do **not** need this. The main install flow uses **prompts only**:

- Run the one install command.
- Enter Bot Token and Chat ID when asked.
- Press Enter for defaults (or choose new values) for max clients and bandwidth.

This file documents the internal config/state format and bot behavior for audit and advanced use.
